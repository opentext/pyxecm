"""
Payload Module to implement functions to process Terrarium payload

This code processes a YAML payload file that includes various settings:
* WebHooks (URLs) to call (e.g. to start-up external services or applications)
* OTDS partitions and OAuth clients
* OTDS trusted sites and system attributes
* OTDS licenses
* Extended ECM users and groups
* Microsoft 365 user, groups, and teams
* Extended ECM Admin Settings (LLConfig)
* Extended ECM External System Connections (SAP, SuccessFactors, ...)
* Extended ECM Transport Packages (scenarios and demo content)
* Extended ECM CS Applications (typically based on Web Reports)
* Extended ECM Web Reports to run
* Extended ECM Workspaces to create (incl. members, workspace relationships)
* Extended ECM user photos, user favorites and user settings
* Extended ECM items to create and permissions to apply
* Extended ECM items to rename
* Extended ECM Documents to generate (from templates)
* Extended ECM assignments (used e.g. for Government scenario)
* Extended ECM Records Management settings, Security Clearance, Supplemental Markings, and Holds
* SAP RFCs (Remote Function Calls)
* Commands to execute in Kubernetes Pods

This code typically runs in a container as part of the cloud automation.

            {
                enabled: True or False to enable or disable the payload item
                name: Name of the authorization handler. This is shown in the first

                description: Description of the handler. This is shown in the second
                             column of the Auth Handler
                type: type of the handler. Possible values are SALM, SAP, OAUTH
                priority: a numeric value to order different handlers in OTDS by priority
                active_by_default: Whether to activate this handler for any request to the
                                   OTDS login page. If True, any login request to the OTDS
                                   login page will be redirected to the IdP. If false, the
                                   user has to select the provider on the login page.
                provider_name: The name of the identity provider. This should be a single word
                               since it will be part of the metadata URL. This is what is
                               shown as a button on the OTDS login page.
                auth_principal_attributes: Authentication principal attributes (list)
                nameid_format: Specifies which NameID format supported by the identity provider
                               contains the desired user identifier. The value in this identifier
                               must correspond to the value of the user attribute specified for the
                               authentication principal attribute.
                saml_url: Required for SAML Authentication Handler. The URL for the IdP's federation metadata.
                otds_sp_endpoint: Used for SAML Authentication Handler. Specifies the service provider URL that will
                                  be used to identify OTDS to the identity provider.
                certificate_file: Required for SAP Authentication Handler (SAPSSOEXT).
                                  Fully qualified file name (with path) to the certificate file (URI)
                certificate_password: Required for SAP Authentication Handler (SAPSSOEXT).
                                      Password of the certificate file.
                client_id: Client ID. Required for OAUTH authentication handler.
                client_secret: Client Secret. Required for OAUTH authentication handler.

                                        The URL to redirect the browser to for authentication.
                                        It is used to retrieve the authorization code or an OIDC id_token.
                token_endpoint: Used for OAUTH authentication handler. The URL from which to retrieve the access token.
                                Not strictly required with OpenID Connect if using the implicit flow.
                scope_string: Used for OAUTH authentication handler. Space delimited scope values to send.
                              Include 'openid' to use OpenID Connect.
