"""
SAP RFC Module to implement Remote Function calls to SAP S/4HANA
For documentation of PyRFC see here: https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC
and here: https://sap.github.io/PyRFC/pyrfc.html 

RFC typically uses port 3300 to communication with the SAP server.
Make sure this port is not blocked by your firewall.

Connection Parameter:
* ashost (hostname or IP address of the application server - this should NOT be a full URL!)
* sysnr (the backend's system number, e.g. 00)
* client (the client or "Mandant" to which to logon, e.g. 100)
* user (e.g. "nwheeler")
* passwd (password of the user)
* lang (logon language as two-character ISO-Code, e.g. EN)
* trace (on of 0(off), 1(brief), 2(verbose), 3(detailed), 4(full))
* use_tls (activates SSL/TLS encryption. Set to 0 or 1. By default TLS is turned on (1))
* tls_client_pse (Specifies the PSE file containing the necessary certificates for TLS communication.
                  A PSE file is a SAP proprietary certificate store, similar to a p12 file,
                  containing the private key and the certificate chain to be used in the TLS
                  handshake with the server, beginning with the server's public certificate and
                  ending with the root CA certifcate. It should also contain the client certificate
                  used for login at the server, if your client program does not use basic
                  user & password authentication)

Class: SAP
Methods:

__init__ : class initializer
call: Calls and RFC based on its name and passes parameters.

        Args:

            options (dictionary, optional): the call options for the RFC call. Defaults to {}.
            * not_requested: Allows to deactivate certain parameters in the function module interface.
              This is particularly useful for BAPIs which have many large tables, the Python client is not interested in.
              Deactivate those, to reduce network traffic and memory consumption in your application considerably.
              This functionality can be used for input and output parameters. If the parameter is an input,
              no data for that parameter will be sent to the backend. If itâ€™s an output, the backend will be
              informed not to return data for that parameter.
            * timeout: Cancel RFC connection if ongoing RFC call not completed within timeout seconds.
              Timeout can be also set as client connection configuration option, in which case is valid for all RFC calls.
            rfc_parameters (dict, optional): the actual RFC parameters thatare specific for
                                                   the type of the call. Defaults to {}.
